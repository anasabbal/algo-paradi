# Algorithmic Paradigms and Techniques

This document provides a comprehensive list of algorithmic paradigms and techniques used to solve various types of computational problems. Each entry includes a brief description of the approach.

## 1. Brute Force

**Description:** Tries all possible solutions and selects the best one.

## 2. Backtracking

**Description:** Builds solutions incrementally and abandons solutions that fail to meet constraints.

## 3. Divide and Conquer

**Description:** Divides a problem into smaller subproblems, solves each subproblem recursively, and combines the results.

## 4. Dynamic Programming

**Description:** Solves problems by breaking them into simpler subproblems and storing the results to avoid redundant computations.

## 5. Greedy Algorithms

**Description:** Makes a series of choices, each of which looks best at the moment, with the hope of finding a global optimum.

## 6. Branch and Bound

**Description:** Explores branches of the solution space systematically and uses bounds to prune suboptimal solutions.

## 7. Heuristic Algorithms

**Description:** Uses practical rules and strategies to find good enough solutions to complex problems.

## 8. Randomized Algorithms

**Description:** Incorporates randomness to achieve better average-case performance or simplicity.

## 9. Iterative Improvement

**Description:** Improves a solution incrementally by repeatedly making small changes and evaluating the outcome. Examples include hill climbing.

## 10. Genetic Algorithms

**Description:** Uses techniques inspired by natural evolution, such as selection, crossover, and mutation, to find optimal solutions.

## 11. Simulated Annealing

**Description:** Uses a probabilistic technique to approximate the global optimum of a given function by simulating the annealing process.

## 12. Constraint Satisfaction

**Description:** Solves problems by finding values for variables that satisfy a set of constraints. Examples include the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) and Constraint Programming.

## 13. Local Search

**Description:** Searches for a solution by iteratively moving to a neighboring solution that improves some objective function. Examples include local search algorithms and hill climbing.

## 14. Network Flow Algorithms

**Description:** Solves problems related to flow networks, such as finding the maximum flow or minimum cut. Examples include Ford-Fulkerson and Edmonds-Karp algorithms.

## 15. Graph Algorithms

**Description:** Includes algorithms for solving problems related to graphs, such as shortest path, minimum spanning tree, and graph traversal. Examples include Dijkstra’s, Kruskal’s, and Prim’s algorithms.

## 16. Pattern Matching Algorithms

**Description:** Finds occurrences of a pattern within a text. Examples include Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) and Rabin-Karp algorithms.

## 17. Approximation Algorithms

**Description:** Provides approximate solutions to optimization problems when exact solutions are computationally infeasible. Examples include algorithms for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

## 18. Monte Carlo Methods

**Description:** Uses random sampling to estimate numerical results and solve problems that might be deterministic in principle.

## 19. Mathematical Programming

**Description:** Uses mathematical models to solve optimization problems, such as Linear Programming (LP) and Integer Programming (IP).
